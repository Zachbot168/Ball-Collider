Physics Ball Collision Engine

Here is a simple ball collision program, utilizing the pygame library in order to draw and simulate movement on a 2D surface. Through using simple kinematic collision equations we are able to simulate the transfer of energy in a perfect world between balls with different mass and different velocities
